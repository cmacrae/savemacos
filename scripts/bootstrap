Welcome to the Save OS X project, an effort to make OS X
a more comfortable system for hackers, developers & power users.

This script will set up your environment for you. It will automatically
install pkgsrc & its associated binary package manager - pkgin.
You will also have the choice to apply a seamless X11 environment that
we've put together for you!

title ""$RED_UL"pkgsrc/pkgin"$ESC""
cat << EOM

`echo -e ""$YELLOW_UL"pkgsrc"$ESC""`
pkgsrc is a framework for building third-party software on NetBSD and other UNIX-like systems,
currently containing over 12000 packages. It is used to enable freely available software to be
configured and built easily on supported platforms.

`echo -e ""$YELLOW_UL"pkgin"$ESC""`
The pkgin command is aimed at being an apt/yum like tool for managing pkgsrc binary packages.
It relies on pkg_summary(5) for installation, removal and upgrade ofpackages and associated 
dependencies, using a remote repository.

Proceeding to download and install pkgsrc/pkgin tools....

Note: You may also need to remove ~/.homebrew. If you happen to be using rvm, then ~/.rvm/bin/brew should
      also be deleted.

# Grab XQuartz
title ""$BLUE_UL"XQuartz + Our X11 Implementation"$ESC""
cat << EOM

`echo -e ""$YELLOW_UL"XQuartz"$ESC""`
XQuartz is an open-source effort to develop a version of the X.Org X Window System that runs on OS X.
Together with supporting libraries and applications, it forms the X11.app that Apple has shipped with
OS X since version 10.5.

`echo -e ""$YELLOW_UL"Our X11 Implementation"$ESC""`
We've put together some little hacks for OS X in an attempt to seamlessly implement an X11 environment,
close to how it would be on any other UNIX-like system. This is achieved using a custom launchd script,
so X launches upon login, and some Aqua UI trickery to hide some elements.

Coupling the above with the wealth of window managers & desktop environments available in our
package repo, you'll feel right at home! Of course, Aqua applications can still be used in conjunction
with X11, so don't fret :)

All processes are complete! So what now? Well, we reccomend you read the
manpage for pkgin at least, as you'll be managing all your non-Apple software
with this excellent package manager.

From here, if you opted for X, get your environment set up, and more importantly; enjoy!
